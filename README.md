## Study 1: A Study of Visual Preferences for Map Label Placement

In this notebook, we present a study designed to better understand the visual preferences of map users and support the development of models for digital map displays. In particular, we found that participants demonstrated preferences for how labels are placed near their point of interest, and that when making trade-offs between alignment and distance of a label, they were more consistent in choosing positions that prioritized alignment over distance. We also investigated if context effects, such as similarity, attraction, or compromise, could be observed when participants chose between equally valued alternatives.
